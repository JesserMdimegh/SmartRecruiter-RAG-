# SmartRecruitAI - Intelligent Recruitment Platform

SmartRecruitAI is an intelligent next-generation recruitment platform that revolutionizes the CV-job matching process by combining Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture.

## 🧠 Three-Level Intelligent Architecture

### Level 1: Extraction & Understanding (NLP + Deep Learning)
- Advanced semantic analysis of CVs (PDF/DOCX) and job offers with BERT/JobBERT
- Automatic extraction of technical skills, soft skills, experience, and education
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying programming languages, frameworks, tools, certifications, diplomas
- Intelligent skill normalization (e.g., "ML" → "Machine Learning", "JS" → "JavaScript")

### Level 2: Vector Matching (Sentence-Transformers + Elasticsearch)
- Generation of semantic embeddings with Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Vector representation of CVs and offers in a 768-dimensional space
- Ultra-fast vector search with Elasticsearch kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
- Cosine similarity calculation for precise and scalable matching
- Multi-criteria compatibility score: technical skills (40%), experience (30%), education (20%), soft skills (10%)

### Level 3: Augmented Intelligence (RAG Architecture)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enrich results with context and explanations
- Explainability AI: each matching score comes with a detailed justification
- Interactive Q&A: recruiters can ask questions in natural language about CVs
- Automatic generation of contextualized CV summaries based on the target position
- Intelligent recommendations with arguments based on real data

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Matching with Explanations
Each match includes a detailed AI-generated explanation:
- **Score**: 87% compatibility
- **Explanation**: Why the candidate is suited for this role
- **Strengths**: ✓ Matched skills and experience
- **Gaps**: ⚠ Missing qualifications
- **Recommendations**: Hiring suggestions

### 2. Conversational Assistant for Recruiters
Recruiters can ask questions in natural language:
- ❓ "Does this candidate have experience in Computer Vision?"
- 🤖 "Yes, the candidate worked on 2 Computer Vision projects: ..."
- ❓ "What are their most impressive projects?"
- 🤖 "Their 3 most notable projects are: ..."

### 3. Automatic Contextual Summary Generation
For each match, RAG generates an executive summary tailored to the position:
- Candidate profile overview
- Strengths for this specific role
- Differentiating skills
- Expected salary compatibility

### 4. Justified Candidate Recommendations
Instead of simple lists, RAG provides argued recommendations:
- 🥇 Top candidates with detailed reasoning
- Comparison between candidates
- Specific recommendations for each profile

### 5. HR Content Generation
- Personalized contact emails
- Interview questions based on skills to validate
- Letters of motivation generation
- Talent pool analysis reports

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Deep Learning Stack
- **📥 Data Ingestion**: PyMuPDF / Tesseract OCR (PDF/image extraction)
- **🧠 NLP Processing**: JobBERT (skill extraction), Sentence-BERT (embeddings), spaCy (linguistic preprocessing)
- **💾 Storage & Search**: Elasticsearch 8+ (vector search with kNN), PostgreSQL (structured metadata), MinIO/S3 (raw file storage)
- **🤖 RAG Engine**: LangChain (RAG orchestration), Mistral-7B-Instruct / GPT-4 (generation), Chroma/Pinecone (alternative vector store), Redis (response cache)
- **⚡ ETL Pipeline**: Apache Airflow (orchestration), Apache Spark (distributed processing), Kafka (real-time streaming)
- **🌐 API & Interface**: FastAPI (REST API), React/Next.js (recruiter interface), Streamlit (analytics dashboard)
